Tutorial Part IV (Adaptivity for Time-Dependent Problems)
=========================================================

Adaptive *hp*-FEM with dynamical meshes for time-dependent 
PDE and PDE systems is one of the most advanced techniques in Hermes. 
Although we have published it in several `scientific articles 
<http://hpfem.org/~pavel/public/papers.html>`_, there is still a lot 
of space for improvement. Do not see the results presented in this section 
as final.
